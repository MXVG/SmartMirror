# SmartMirror
The Smart Mirror project is a software solution tailored for Raspberry Pi-based smart mirrors. This project combines the power of embedded computing with a two-way reflective mirror, transforming 
a seemingly ordinary mirror into an interactive and information-rich display. Designed to enhance the user's daily routine, the Smart Mirror 
displays a variety of relevant information and features a sleek and modern design.
